 1. To create a custom Parse class you need to inherit from PFObject and implement the PFSubclassing protocol
 2. Next, define each property that you want to access on this Parse class. For our Post class that's the user and the imageFile of a post. That will allow you to change the code that accesses properties through strings post["imageFile"] = imageFile into code that uses Swift properties post.imageFile = imageFile. Notice that we prefixed the properties with @NSManaged. This tells the Swift compiler that we won't initialize the properties in the initializer, because Parse will take care of it for us.
 3. By implementing the parseClassName static function, you create a connection between the Parse class and your Swift class.
 4. init and initialize are purely boilerplate code - copy these two into any custom Parse class that you're creating.

     1.  First we are checking whether likes.value already has stored a value or is nil. If we've already stored a value, we will skip the entire method. As discussed, we will cache all likes until the entire timeline is refreshed (which we haven't implemented yet). So as soon as likes.value has a cached value, we don't need to perform the body of this method.
     2. We fetch the likes for the current Post using the ParseHelper likesForPost method that we created earlier
     3. There is a new concept on this line: the filter method that we call on our Array. The filter method takes a closure and returns an array that only contains the objects from the original array that meet the requirement stated in that closure. The closure passed to the filter method gets called for each element in the array, each time passing the current element as the like argument to the closure. Note that you can pick any arbitrary name for the argument that we called like. So why are we filtering the array in the first place? We are removing all likes that belong to users that no longer exist in our Makestagram app (because their account has been deleted). Without this filtering the next statement could crash.
     4. Here we are again using a new method: map. The map method behaves similarly to the filter method in that it takes a closure that is called for each element in the array and in that it also returns a new array as a result. The difference is that, unlike filter, map does not remove objects but replaces them. In this particular case we are replacing the likes in the array with the users that are associated with the like. We start with an array of likes and retrieve an array of users. Then we assign the result to our likes.value property.
