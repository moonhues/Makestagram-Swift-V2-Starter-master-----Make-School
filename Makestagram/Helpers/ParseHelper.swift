     1. As discussed, we modify the method signature to accept a Range argument. That Range argument will define which portions of the timeline will be loaded. Range literals can be defined like this: 5..10 (10 included) or 5..<10 (10 excluded).
     2. PFQuery provides a skip property. That allows us - as suspected by the name - to define how many elements that match our query shall be skipped. This is the equivalent of the startIndex of our range, so all we need to do is a simple assignment.
     3. We make use of an additional property of PFQuery: limit. The limit property defines how many elements we want to load. We calculate the size of the range (by subtracting the startIndex from the endIndex) and pass the result to the limit property.

     1. That's the default signature for the callback of most Parse queries. It takes an optional result and an optional error. By taking this type of block as an argument, we can hand it directly to the findObjectsInBackgroundWithBlock method! This way, whoever has called the likesForPost method will get the results in the callback block that they provide.
     2. We are using the includeKey(_) method to tell Parse to fetch the PFUser object for each of the likes (we've discussed includeKey(_) in detail when building the timeline request). We want to fetch the PFUser along with the likes because later on we want to display the usernames of all users that have liked a post. Remember, without the includeKey(_) line, we would just have a reference to a PFUser and would have to start a separate request to fetch the information about the user.

     1.  We are going to wrap all of our helper methods into a class called ParseHelper. We only do this so that all of the functions are bundled under the ParseHelper namespace. That makes the code easier to read in some cases. To call the timeline request function you call ParseHelper.timelineRequestforUser... instead of simply timelineRequestforUser. That way you always know exactly in which file you can find the methods that are being called.
     
     2. We mark this method as static. This means we can call it without having to create an instance of ParseHelper - you should do that for all helper methods. This method has only one parameter, completionBlock: the callback block that should be called once the query has completed. The type of this parameter is PFQueryArrayResultBlock. That's the default type for all of the callbacks in the Parse framework. By taking this callback as a parameter, we can call any Parse method and return the result of the method to that completionBlock - you'll see how we use that in 3.
     
     3. The entire body of this method is unchanged, it's the exact timeline query that we've built within the TimelineViewController. The only difference is the last line of the method. Instead of providing a closure and handling the results of the query within this method, we hand off the results to the closure that has been handed to use through the completionBlock parameter. This means whoever calls the timelineRequestForCurrentUser method will be able to handle the result returned from the query!
